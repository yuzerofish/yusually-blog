# Consolidate Tooling Configuration for Vite+ Migration

## Problem Description

The Prism analytics platform team has been running a TypeScript frontend library for two years. Over that time, configuration has accumulated organically: a separate Vitest config, a standalone oxlint config, tsdown for packaging, and Husky for pre-commit hooks. The project was recently updated to Vite 8 and Vitest 4.1, making it eligible for Vite+ adoption.

The team's tech lead wants to migrate to Vite+ and consolidate everything into its unified config format. She's especially keen on enabling proper type-aware linting across the codebase — the project has had latent type errors slip through because the existing oxlint setup doesn't perform type-aware checks. However, a previous spike by a colleague enabled the lint options in a test branch and found that type-aware checks silently weren't running, even with the options turned on. The colleague suspected it might be related to a tsconfig setting but didn't track down the root cause before moving on.

Your task is to perform the migration: consolidate all configuration into `vite.config.ts`, enable the team's desired type-aware checking correctly, and replace the Husky hook setup with the Vite+ equivalent. Produce the migrated config files and a brief `MIGRATION.md` explaining what changed and the recommended migration procedure for future reference.

## Output Specification

Produce the following files:

- `vite.config.ts` — the consolidated Vite+ config incorporating lint, test, pack, and staged-hook configuration
- `tsconfig.json` — updated TypeScript config (address any settings incompatible with Vite+ features you discover)
- `package.json` — updated with corrected scripts and dependencies reflecting the new toolchain
- `MIGRATION.md` — brief notes on what was consolidated, what the recommended migration entry point is, and any gotchas the team should know about (especially around type-aware checking)

Organize the output so that any configuration files no longer needed under Vite+ conventions are absent from your output — the team will delete them from the repo based on what you produce.

# Vite+ Upgrade for a Production TypeScript Library

## Problem Description

The Nexus UI team maintains a widely-used TypeScript component library that was migrated to Vite+ six months ago. Vite+ has since released several updates with bug fixes and new features the team wants to take advantage of, particularly improvements to the type-aware lint pass and faster test startup times.

The team's senior engineer is on leave, and the remaining engineers are unsure of the correct upgrade procedure. A previous attempt by a well-meaning team member ran `pnpm update vite-plus` directly, which updated the `package.json` entry for `vite-plus` but left the project in a broken state — `vp check` was reporting errors that hadn't existed before and `vp test` was running the wrong Vitest version. It took an hour of debugging to realize the issue: some underlying packages hadn't been updated.

The team needs a clear, correct upgrade runbook they can follow now and reuse for future upgrades. They also want a shell script (`upgrade-vite-plus.sh`) that automates the steps so that future upgrades are one-command operations. The script should handle both the local tooling on the developer's machine and the project-level dependencies, in the right order, and include verification steps so the engineer knows the upgrade succeeded before they push.

## Output Specification

Produce the following files:

- `upgrade-vite-plus.sh` — a shell script that performs the complete upgrade procedure in the correct order, including verification
- `UPGRADE.md` — a human-readable runbook explaining each step, why it is needed, and what to do if a step fails

Both files should document all necessary steps a developer would need to run to fully upgrade Vite+. The script should be executable as-is (no placeholder TODOs).

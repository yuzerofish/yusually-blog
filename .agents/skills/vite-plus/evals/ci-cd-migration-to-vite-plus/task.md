# Standardize CI for a Frontend Utility Library

## Problem/Feature Description

The `@acme/utils` team maintains a TypeScript utility library used across several internal products. Their GitHub Actions setup was written before Vite+ was adopted and still uses a hand-rolled Node bootstrapping pattern: they install Corepack, activate pnpm through it, and run `pnpm install` manually before running tests with a direct vitest invocation. The CI also includes a separate release workflow that handles npm publishing and creating GitHub releases.

The team has since fully adopted Vite+ as their toolchain. Their tech lead wants to standardize CI to match the current toolchain and reduce maintenance overhead — ideally by trimming the bootstrap boilerplate — while making sure nothing in the release process breaks.

## Output Specification

Produce updated GitHub Actions workflow files for this repository under `.github/workflows/`. The two workflow files are `ci.yml` (the main test/verify workflow) and `release.yml` (the publish workflow). Both should be written as complete, valid YAML files. Also write a brief `migration-notes.md` describing what changed and why.

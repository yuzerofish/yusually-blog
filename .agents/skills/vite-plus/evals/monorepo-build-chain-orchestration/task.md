# Monorepo Root Script Setup for UI Library and Docs Site

## Problem Description

The Luminary design system team maintains a TypeScript monorepo that contains a publishable component library (`packages/luminary-ui`) and a documentation/demo site (`apps/docs`). The docs app imports the UI library via the workspace protocol so it can showcase and test components before publishing.

The team recently decided to adopt Vite+ as their unified toolchain. A junior engineer made an initial attempt at wiring up root-level scripts but hit a frustrating issue: the build script for the docs app would sometimes build only the docs app without including the library's latest output, causing stale component renders. They tried using `pnpm --filter` to pull in the library transitively but observed inconsistent results depending on the pnpm version. The dev workflow is also broken — starting dev mode immediately hits missing module errors because the library's `dist/` folder doesn't exist yet.

The repo is a pnpm workspace. The library is an OSS-published package that external users will install from npm, so the docs site serves as integration verification that the published artifact resolves correctly end-to-end. The team wants the root scripts to handle four scenarios correctly: building the docs site for deployment, running development with hot reload across both packages, running tests across the workspace, and setting up pre-commit checks.

## Output Specification

Produce the following files reflecting the corrected Vite+ based monorepo setup:

- `package.json` — root package.json with corrected `scripts` block (the rest of the file can remain as provided)
- `apps/docs/vite.config.ts` — Vite config for the docs app
- `vite.config.ts` — root vite.config.ts with workspace-wide hook and staged configuration
- `packages/luminary-ui/package.json` — library package.json with corrected scripts

You may also produce a short `SETUP.md` explaining how to run each workflow, updated to reflect the new commands.
